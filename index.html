        <h1>Comparative Anatomy</h1>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Comparative Anatomy is a type of evidence for evolution that looks at the similar anatomy between different
            species, and correlates them. This is a mostly an observation-based evidence for evolution.</p>
        <h2>Types of Structures</h2>
        <div class="types-of-structures">
            <div class="col-4">
                <p><b>Vestigial: </b>Structures that have apparent functions in one species, but not another. Evolution
                    suggests that the newer species generally inherit vestigial structures from their ancestors, but
                    stopped using them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <p><b>Homologous: </b>Structures that look similar, but may have different functions. Evolution proposes
                    that the structures used to have similar looks and functions, but changed as the organisms evolved
                    and diverged.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <p><b>Analagous: </b>Structures that have the same functions, but that look different.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="examples-flaws">
            <div class="col-6">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>The picture shows an example of homologous structures between a horse and a dog. We see that they are
                    shaped similarly, and have common bones. This proves that dogs and horses are closer together on the
                    evolutionary timeline.</p>
                <h2>Flaws/Limitations</h2>
                <p>Analagous structures cannot be used as evidence for evolution because common uses are not as strong
                    as an indicator as common structures. For example, both dogs and lizards have legs, but that does
                    not mean that lizards evolved from dogs or vice versa.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <div class="text">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>An evidence of evolution that says animals that look similar longer during their embryonic stages are
                    more closely related. </p>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>Biologists and Embryologists use a microscope to observe the embryos of different animals and find
                    similarities and differences.</p>
                <h2>Flaws/Limitations</h2>
                <p>Species that have homologous structures after birth may be loosely related during their embryonic
                    phases, and vice-versa. </p>
            </div>

                <div class="elfsight-app-200c0236-88e4-44b4-ba13-7b9d1e234e1d"></div>

        </div>
        <p>These are the early embryoes of a human and a bird. Right now, they are very similar, but as they grow, they become more and more different. Species that stay more similar longer are more related. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Conclusion" id="Conclusion" style="background-color: black; color: white; margin: 0%;">
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Both of these evidences are not enough to prove evolution on their own. They need to be corroborated with
            other methodologies to holistically understand support the idea of evolution. <br></p>
